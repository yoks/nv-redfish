//! Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) client abstraction
//!
//! This module defines the transport-agnostic [`Bmc`] trait — a minimal
//! interface for interacting with Redfish services. Implementors provide
//! asynchronous operations to retrieve and expand entities, create/update
//! resources, delete entities, and invoke actions.
//!
//! Key concepts:
//! - Entity identity: Every entity is identified by an `@odata.id` ([`crate::ODataId`]).
//! - Entity reference: Generated types implement [`crate::EntityTypeRef`], which
//!   exposes `id()` and optional `etag()` accessors.
//! - Arc-based sharing: Read operations return `Arc<T>` to enable cheap sharing
//!   and caching while keeping values immutable.
//! - Expansion: [`crate::Expandable`] entities can request inline expansion using
//!   [`crate::http::ExpandQuery`], matching Redfish DSP0266 semantics for `$expand`.
//! - Actions: Actions are described by [`crate::Action<T, R>`] and are invoked via
//!   the `action` method.
//!
//! Operation semantics:
//! - `get` fetches the entity at the given `@odata.id`.
//! - `expand` fetches the entity with the provided `$expand` query.
//! - `create` typically performs a POST to a collection identified by `id` and
//!   returns the server-provided representation (`R`).
//! - `update` typically performs a PATCH on an entity identified by `id` and
//!   returns the updated representation (`R`).
//! - `delete` removes the entity at `id`.
//! - `action` posts to an action endpoint (`Action.target`).
//!
//! Notes for implementors:
//! - The trait is `Send + Sync` and returns `Send` futures to support use in
//!   async runtimes and multithreaded contexts.
//! - Implementations may include client-side caching or conditional requests;
//!   these details are intentionally abstracted behind the trait.
//! - Errors should implement `std::error::Error` and be safely transferable
//!   across threads.
