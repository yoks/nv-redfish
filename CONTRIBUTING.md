### Naming conventions in NV-Redfish library

NV-Redfish follows Redfish’s distinction between collections and single resources. When adding new code:

- **Cargo features**: use **plural** kebab-case for collections, and **singular** kebab-case for singleton services.
- **Rust modules/files**: keep names **singular** (snake_case) and aligned with the corresponding Redfish CSDL entity or complex type.
- **Rust APIs (methods/fields)**: use **plural** snake_case for accessors that return collections, and **singular** snake_case for accessors that return a single resource or service.

In all cases, aim for consistency with the Redfish schema: plural means “many”, singular means “one”, and the same idea should apply to features, modules, and API names.

## Signing Your Work

We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

### How to Sign Off

Any contribution which contains commits that are not signed-off will not be accepted.

To sign off on a commit, use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Add cool feature"
```

This will append the following to your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```
