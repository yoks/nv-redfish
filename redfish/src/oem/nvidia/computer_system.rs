//! Support NVIDIA ComputerSystem OEM extension.
//!
//! The resource is the NVIDIA `NvidiaComputerSystem` OEM object and is
//! returned as the compiled schema type.
//!
//! The BlueField DPU diverges from that schema twice, and both
//! divergences are handled as platform quirks rather than as a schema
//! of their own:
//!
//! * it serves the object as a separate resource and inlines only a
//!   partially expanded stub under `Oem.Nvidia`, so the body has to be
//!   fetched from `@odata.id`;
//! * that body carries `BaseMAC` and `Mode`. Neither is declared by the
//!   CSDL the device publishes, and the NVIDIA OEM schema set not only
//!   omits them but marks the type `OData.AdditionalProperties=false`,
//!   so no schema route to them exists or should be invented.
//!
//! Both apply only on the platform detected as the DPU. Drop
//! [`NvidiaComputerSystem::base_mac`] and [`NvidiaComputerSystem::mode`]
//! once firmware either stops sending them or declares them properly.
